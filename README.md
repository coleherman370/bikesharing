## Results

Through the analysis we are able to see the bike sharing is most popular among Males and occurs most frequently within the major city limits. Another key thing of note is that the bike share program is utilized most heavily within 7-9am and 4-6pm. This finding suggests that the primary utilization of the bike share program is for commuters going to and from work.

## Summary

- After geographically mapping the ending times, it shows that the common trend appears to be that users are utilizing the bike share program as a means of commuting into the city center. This suggests that the bikes are being used a means of commuting to work.
